# Movie Matchup | Final Capstone Project
​
An application allowing users to create a profile to save movie genre preferences that will return recommended movies based on user preference.  Users can view details about movies, read and write reviews, save movies to their personal watchlist, as well as browse movies by genre.  An admin page was also implemented into the application allowing admin users the ability to search more than 1 million movies, and add/remove it from the application.

## Project Background
​
This was a team project completed as our final capstone at Tech Elevator.  We created  a database to store user info, movies, reviews, and genres.  The backend is written in Java, utilizing JdbcTemplate to connect to our database.  We consumed the TMDB API and utilized for our admin access/movie data.  The front-end is written in Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
